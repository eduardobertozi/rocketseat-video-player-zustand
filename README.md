# Rocketseat Video Player With Zustand and Redux
This project was created to practice using external state managers such as Zustand and Redux.
By my personal choice, I made Zustand my default, the objective is to have a comparison between the two libs.
To check the different implementations, just change the branch to 'zustand' or 'redux'. Soon I will
bring a new example with Nextjs.
